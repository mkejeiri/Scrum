# Scrum
### In nutshell
* It is an agile framework which helps people to address complex and increasingly chaotic software development (or any other type of industry) while actively delivering product in each sprints (iteration)
* Unlike PMI or Prince2 which focus on processes Scrum is more people oriented, customers centric delivering a business value at an early stage allowing stakeholders, product owners, self-organized and motivated scrum team & scrum master to get actively involved throughout the project and to make sure a faster & well fitted business requirement product delivery which goes hand in hand with the initial project vision.

* It allows stakeholders, product owners, scrum team and scrum master to remove any impediments and detect risk and uncertainties of the project at an early stage.

* Further, Scrum is an extendable framework which also could be nicely scale up to address/manage Portfolios and programs in larger organisations. 

> > I gladly shared documents and also a free certification course (scrum fundamentals certified) [link](https://www.scrumstudy.com) which allow anyone (newbies or with prior experience) who is willing to get a closer look at the framework and to learn at his own pace in a flexible way.


Enjoy the ride!
